# Crestron Vite Testing

This is a repository to test Compatability of Vite with Crestron Touchpanels.

This simple test is tested working with a TS-1070 (tsw-xx70_2.004.0033.001.puf) and a TSW-760 (tsw-xx60_3.002.0050.001.puf).

Routing, Pinia and more Features still need to be tested.

## webxpanel is also working

Tested with a hardened VC-4 Server (vc-4_4.0001.00055.zip).

The Linux Group needs to be added in the VC-4 Websettings under "Authentication Management" and the Self signed Certificate of the Websocket Server needs to be accepted.
